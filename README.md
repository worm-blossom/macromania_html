# Macromania HTML

Macros for [Macromania](https://github.com/worm-blossom/macromania) to generate
[html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

This module is slightly opinionated: deprecated and non-standard tags and
attributes are not supported.

Typings for the macros are based on the
[definitely-typed React typescript typings](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/react),
which are not fully accurate and might be incomplete or overly restrictive.
Please open an issue if you run into trouble.
